Ammonia Analysis

In this project I will analyse the factors that impact the percentage of ammonia in a chemical plant.

The ammonia oxidates to nitric acid, therefore we want the less percentage of ammonia as possible.

The csv file that was used on the analysis is attached on the Ammonia_Analysis repository on github, and the complete analysis can be found on the following link in my website:
